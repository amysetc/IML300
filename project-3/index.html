                The Big Read is a "partnership between the <br />National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and Arts Midwest" that strives to spark meaningful conversations through books and reading. <br /> It differs between different programs across the states, but for Wichita, a book is voted on for the year to provide a diverse and broader range of narratives! Public libraries across the city are given plenty of free copies of the said voted book. Curated events about the book and its themes are organized, and projects (like this one) are created to increase community engagement reading!
