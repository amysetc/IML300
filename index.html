        concept: One of my favorite passions is photography, and I love
        capturing moments of nostalgia within each photo I take or am in.
        Another passion of mine is music, so I associated some of my favorite
        songs with some of my favorite polaroids. It is basically a sort of
        interactive scrapbook! I have a whole photoalbum of so many hundreds of
        polaroids, so it was cool to have them sort of come to life

      <h3>
        my hypernarrative is about the many songs i have written. i always
        wanted to share them, but there were so many things that impeded me too.
        one is that i never really shared my passion for music, especially now
        that i've been in MAP where i focus on other fields, but the main reason
        is because none of these songs are actually finished. because things
        weren't finished, i felt that they would be criticized more than if they
        were done. this perfectionistic view caused me to not share nor finish
        them at all. however, i've come to realize that unfinished things can be
        appreciated. these songs highlight a different time in my life, and it
        illustrates my growth now. this project also taught me to not focus so
        much on finishing things or constantly reaching a goal. i am also an
        unfinished being, and i still can enjoy many parts of life such as my
        music!

      <a href="">project 3: networked justice</a>
      <h3>
        My concept for Project 3 will center around my documentary series I
        created last semester over the novel The House On Mango Street by Sandra
        Cisneros. The major theme revolving around the novel and the documentary
        is the diverse Hispanic immigrant experience. Through each episode,
        viewers are introduced to a Hispanic individual from Wichita, KS, and
        each story is a unique glimpse into one’s journey as a Hispanic
        immigrant or child of immigrants. For unknown reasons, Big Read was not
        able to showcase the series, so this website is for all those who were a
        part of the process so that they can see the end product of the series.
        Additionally, it allows those to learn more about the people in my
        community. They’ve made such big differences in the city, and their
        experiences should be highlighted. It allows everyone to reevaluate
        concerns around immigration and being a person of color in a
        predominantly white town.
